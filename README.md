# Pokemon-Battle
A Python program which simulates a Pokémon battle based on a combination of Pokémon, the War card game, and Rock, Paper, Scissors.

A Pokémon has 4 characteristics: name, type, health points, and damage points.  At the start,
each Pokémon has an initial amount of health points.  During the battle, a Pokémon will lose
health points if it loses a round.  The damage points of the winning Pokémon determine the
decrease in health points of the losing Pokémon during a round.  If a Pokémon’s health points
reach 0 or below, it faints and is out of the battle.

Valid Pokémon types are: Fire, Water, and Grass.  Each of the types can defeat exactly one other type. 
	Water douses Fire
   	Fire burns Grass
   		Grass consumes Water
